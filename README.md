# No severe genetic bottleneck in a rapidly range-expanding bumblebee pollinator

R code and data used for the analyses carried out in Brock _et al._, 2021 - No severe genetic bottleneck in a rapidly range-expanding bumblebee pollinator (DOI: 10.1098/rspb.2020.2639).

These codes allow for the estimation of levels of genetic diversity (i.e. allelic richness, expected and observed heterozygosity etc.), bottleneck estimation (via sign test and M ratio tests), and levels of diploid male production, from microsatellite genotyping data collected from workers and males within a UK Tree Bumblebee (_Bombus hypnorum_) population.
